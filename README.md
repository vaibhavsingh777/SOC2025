Automated Trading Strategy Optimization Using Multi-Modal Reinforcement Learning
Learning Objectives
Hello! In this project, I have tried to learn and apply some basic machine learning techniques for stock market data. Let me explain what all I have done here:

Understanding and Implementing Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and KNN:
First, I wanted to get comfortable with these three famous algorithms. So, I have taken Linear Regression for predicting next day’s stock price, Logistic Regression for checking if the price will go up or down, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for classifying the price movement. I have implemented all these step by step.

Fetching and Processing Real Stock Data using yfinance:
Instead of using some dummy data, I thought, “Why not use real stock market data only?” So, I have used the yfinance library to download daily stock prices for one year. I tried with AAPL, TCS, Reliance and all. After downloading, I did some cleaning and made it ready for the models.

Feature Engineering and Machine Learning for Prediction and Classification:
For getting better results, I have created some new features from the data, like next day’s close price and binary target for up/down movement. After that, I trained the models and checked how well they are predicting. I also plotted graphs to see the results clearly.

Setup
For running this project, I have used Python and installed some libraries like yfinance, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. If you are trying this, just make sure to install these packages.

Let me know if you want a more detailed description for each part, or if you want the rest of the README in this style!

Learning Objectives
Hello! In this project, I have explored some basic machine learning techniques for stock market data. Let me break down what I have done, part by part, in my own words.

1. Understanding and Implementing Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and KNN
   Linear Regression:
   I started with Linear Regression because it is a simple and powerful method for predicting continuous values. Here, I used it to predict the next day’s closing price of a stock based on today’s data. I wanted to see how well the model can guess tomorrow’s price just by looking at today’s numbers like open, high, low, close, and volume.

Logistic Regression:
After that, I moved to Logistic Regression. This one is mainly for classification problems. So, I used it to predict whether the stock price will go up or down the next day. I converted the problem into a simple yes/no (1/0) type, and trained the model to classify the movement.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Then, I tried KNN, which is a very intuitive algorithm. It looks at the ‘k’ closest data points and decides the class based on majority. I used KNN to classify the price movement, and also experimented with different values of ‘k’ to see which one works best.

2. Fetching and Processing Real Stock Data Using yfinance
   I didn’t want to use any fake or sample data, so I used the yfinance library to download real stock data from Yahoo Finance. I tried with different tickers like AAPL, TCS.NS, RELIANCE.NS, and TSLA.

I fetched one year of daily data for each stock. After downloading, I checked the data, removed any missing values, and made sure it was clean and ready for analysis.

This step helped me understand how to work with real-world data, which is usually messy and needs some cleaning before using in any model.

3. Feature Engineering and Machine Learning for Prediction and Classification
   I created new features from the existing data to make the models work better. For example, I made a new column for the next day’s closing price (for regression) and a binary target column to indicate if the price went up or down (for classification).

I split the data into training and testing sets, so that I can train the models on one part and test on another to see how well they perform.

After training the models, I checked their performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (for regression) and Accuracy/Confusion Matrix (for classification).

I also plotted graphs to visualize the actual vs predicted values, and confusion matrices to see where the models are making mistakes. This helped me understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Setup
For this project, I used Python and installed libraries like yfinance, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

If you want to try this out, just make sure to install these packages before running the code.

Part 1: Downloading Stock Data
Task 1.1: Fetch 1-Year Daily Data ticker = "AAPL" # You can also try "TCS.NS", "RELIANCE.NS", "TSLA", etc. data = yf.download(ticker, period="1y") data.head()

Part 2: Linear Regression – Predicting Next Day’s Close Price

Part 3: Logistic Regression – Predicting Price Movement

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)
